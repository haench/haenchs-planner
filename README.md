## haenchs planner

- haenchs planner uses google tasks/calendar as a backend.
- Login with your google account.
- it’s basically a nicer way to organize tasks

## Features:

- all basic google tasks features (lists, tasks, notes, sorting ...)
- task list grouping: on top of Google’s task lists you can organize tasklists into groups. To enable this and still use other google tasks apps your need to prepent a group abbrevation. In theconfig you can associate the abbreviation with a group name. E.g. name a list “W - ToDo” and associate W with work. The list TODO will now appear in the work group. Other apps will still show it as “w - ToDo”
- markdown notes: I am a heavy user of the notes feature, which is basically a plain Text associated with a task. In henchs planner you can write these texts with markdown (git hub flavored). Other apps will just show the plain markdown text, which should be readable as well - just not as nice as Haench app does it.

## Build with:

- react
- react easy State
- Styled components
- styled icons (feather)
- simple mde
- google gapi (Google tasks api)

## future development

- calendar
